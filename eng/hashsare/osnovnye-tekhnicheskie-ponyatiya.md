# 📘 Key Technical Concepts

## 💻 ASIC

🔹 **What is it?**

ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is a specialized device optimized for computing hash functions required to add new blocks to the blockchain.

🔹 **Features:**

• Designed exclusively for performing mining algorithm computations, such as SHA-256 for Bitcoin.

## ⚡ Hashrate

🔹 **What is it?**

Hashrate is the speed at which a mining device performs cryptographic computations to find new blocks in the blockchain.

🔹 **Measurement Units:**

• H/s (hashes per second) — base unit.\
• KH/s (kilohashes) = 1,000 H/s.\
• MH/s (megahashes) = 1,000,000 H/s.\
• GH/s (gigahashes) = 1,000,000,000 H/s.\
• TH/s (terahashes) = 1,000,000,000,000 H/s.

🔹 **Why is it important?**

The higher the hashrate, the greater the device’s chance of finding the correct hash and receiving mining rewards.

## 🛠️ Hashrate per Board

🔹 **What is it?**

The computing speed of individual boards inside an ASIC miner.

🔹 **Features:**

• ASIC miners consist of multiple boards, each responsible for a portion of the computations.\
• Hashrate per board displays the performance of each board and its contribution to the device’s total hashrate.

🔹 **Measurement Units:**

The same as the total hashrate of the device: H/s, KH/s, MH/s, GH/s, TH/s, but on a smaller scale.

## 🌡️ Device Temperature

🔹 **What is it?**

The temperature of key ASIC miner components, such as chips and boards, during operation.

🔹 **Why is it important?**

• Maintaining an optimal temperature ensures device stability, longevity, and performance.\
• Overheating can lead to operational failures.

🔹 **Measurement Units:**

• °C (degrees Celsius).\
• °F (degrees Fahrenheit).

## 🔄 Device Fan Speed

🔹 **What is it?**

The rotation speed of the device’s fans, which provide cooling.

🔹 **Measurement Units:**

• RPM (revolutions per minute).

🔹 **Role:**

• Faster fan rotation improves cooling.\
• Ensures stable device operation under high loads.

🎯 **Note:**

These terms are essential for understanding the functionality of ASIC miners and mining processes in general. They will help you better navigate the system and its capabilities.
