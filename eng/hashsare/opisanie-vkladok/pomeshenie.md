# 🏠 Facility

A "Room" is an entity one level below a "Data Center", which:

• Is linked to a single data center.

• Includes one or more connected racks.

• Displays data only for devices located in the racks within this room.



The "Rooms" page is similar to the "Data Center" interface but provides information specific to the selected room.
