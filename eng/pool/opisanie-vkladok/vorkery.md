# Workers

In the Bullpool system, devices are called workers. These are key elements that:

‚Ä¢ Represent one or more combined devices connected to a mining pool.

‚Ä¢ Perform cryptocurrency mining tasks.

## What Does a Worker Do?

Each worker:

‚Ä¢ üñ•Ô∏è Performs computational tasks to solve blocks.

‚Ä¢ üìä Monitors performance ‚Äî the pool records the results of its work.

‚Ä¢ ‚ö° Optimizes cryptocurrency mining efficiency.

## Worker Table: Key Information and Parameters

The worker table provides complete information about each device connected to the pool. Here are the main columns and their values:

### 1. Miner

Worker identifier (ID Worker) in the pool. It allows quick identification of the device and its connection to the pool.

### 2. Average Hashrate

Device hashrate over different time intervals:

‚Ä¢ 10-minute average ‚Äî short-term performance indicator.

‚Ä¢ Hourly average ‚Äî averaged value over the last hour.

‚Ä¢ 24-hour average ‚Äî long-term device stability indicator.

These data help analyze mining efficiency and identify deviations.

### 3. Rejected Shares Percentage (Reject Rate)

This metric shows the proportion of shares (task solutions) sent by the device but not accepted by the pool.

‚Ä¢ Expressed as a percentage.

‚Ä¢ Indicates the efficiency of data transmission between the device and the pool.

‚Ä¢ A high Reject Rate may indicate network issues or device misconfiguration.

### 4. Last Submission Time

The time of the last share submission to the pool.

‚Ä¢ Data updates every 5 minutes.

### 5. Status

Current device state:

‚Ä¢ Active ‚Äî the device is working and data is being received by the pool.

‚Ä¢ Inactive ‚Äî no data is being received from the device (possible connection or device issues).

### 6. Actions

An interactive button that allows:

‚Ä¢ Viewing the worker‚Äôs hashrate fluctuation graph.

‚Ä¢ Analyzing the rejection rate (rejected shares).
